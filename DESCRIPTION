Description: The multispecies and Individual-based model (IBM) OSMOSE focuses on fish species.
  This model assumes opportunistic predation based on spatial co-occurrence and size 
  adequacy between a predator and its prey (size-based opportunistic predation). It
  represents fish individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their
  size, weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location (2D model), and which undergo
  major processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural and starvation
  mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing exploitation. The model needs
  basic biological parameters that are often available for a wide range of species, and
  which can be found in FishBase for instance, and fish spatial distribution data. This
  package provides tools to build a model and run simulations using the OSMOSE model. See
  <http://www.osmose-model.org/> for more details.
